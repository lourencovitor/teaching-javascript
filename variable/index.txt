// Learning javascript variables

Inside javascript we have 3 types of variables:

- var (global variable) to learn more about go to var.js file
- let (local variable) to learn more about go to let.js file
- const (local variable) to learn more about go to const.js file

It is important that we already know the types of data that exist as:

- number(exemple = 0)
- string(exemple = "Test")
- boolean(exemple = true || false)
- array(exemple = [1,2,3,4,5])
- object(exemple = {name:"Gabi", age:17, married:false})
