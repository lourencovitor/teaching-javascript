Logical operators

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. 
When they are, they return a Boolean value. 
However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specific operands, 
so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they can return a non-Boolean value.

There are three types of logical operators they are:

- AND (&&)

- OR (||)

- NOT (!)
