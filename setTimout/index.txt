The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

Tip: 1000 ms = 1 second.

Tip: The function is only executed once. If you need to repeat execution, use the setInterval() method.

Tip: Use the clearTimeout() method to prevent the function from running.
